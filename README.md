## Running the code

There are two ways of running particular solution. One can either go to the directory associated with the given day, for
example:

```shell
cd 2022/day01
```

and run it from there:

```shell
cargo run --release
```

Alternatively, there's a dedicated `solution-runner` binary that's can run any sub-solution based on arguments provided.
For example

```shell
./solution-runner --year 2022 --day 1
```

### Note:

solutions from 2019, 2020 and 2021 are not guaranteed to run correctly,
as they got imported from old repositories and have not been written with the current runner framework in mind.

## Adding new day

Run the following command to generate the template:

```shell
cargo run -p aoc-init -- --year $YEAR --day $DAY
```

[//]: # (It further has optional flags `custom-input-filepath` and `custom-input` for providing non-default inputs.)
